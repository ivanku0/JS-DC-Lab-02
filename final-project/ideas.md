1. Idea 1: Persona 5 inspired sentiment tracker.

Persona 5 is a video game that has a fake survey that tracks how the fake NPCs in the game feel about a group known as the phantom thieves. This is accomplished by having a one question survey that asks "Are the Phantom Thieves good?" Site visitors answer yes or no and that is then displayed as a percentage in a progress bar, measuring the distribution of YES to NO answers. Beneath this bar contains a series of comments that are made by people when they make the vote as well.

I want to do something like this but utilize the Twitter API to generate the commentary and sentiments. So rather than asking a Yes or no question, I would ask the user to insert the name of a Twitter handle, like @therealdonaldfrump and that would be displayed as "Is @therealdonaldfrump good?" and in real-time, i would like to scrape Twitter for any tweets that contain this person's name and assess the language to see if the language around that person is positive or negative. I would like to take on tweets in real-time and then have the progress meter adjust in real-time according to tweets that come in. These tweets will also show up beneath the progress bar as the bar's value gets adjusted.


2. I want to make 4d tetris in the browser

Basically, tetris only works in one direction: top down. What if your pieces emerged from the center and you had to play tetris by going bottom up, left to right, or right to left, AND top down? That's kind of what i want to do

3. Make a javascript vocabulary builder

i have a theory that learning coding as a language is difficult because its hard to track and remember what you actually know in addition to simply knowing how to code. I would be interested in creating some type of webapplication that allows users to paste in code from their homework/learnings and to generate a dashboard that shows off concepts (and related concepts) users should know based off the code they're pasting in. I think it would also be neat to link this dashboard with resources/commonly voted things from stackoverflow's API to supplement the vocabulary building.
